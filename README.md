# CMakeLibTemplate
CMakeLibTemplate is a comprehensive template designed to streamline the process of building a library using `CMake`. This template provides a solid foundation, including a clear and organized directory structure, essential CMake configuration files, and best practices for library development. With CMakeLibTemplate, developers can quickly set up a new project with consistent build settings and focus on writing their library code, rather than spending time on initial configuration. Whether you are developing a static or shared library, this template ensures a smooth and efficient start to your CMake-based project.

# Features
* Build the Library: Easily compile your library with CMake.
* Examples: Include example code to demonstrate how to use your library.
* Tests Using Google Test: Integrate unit tests using Google Test framework to ensure your library works as expected.
* Documentation Using Doxygen: Generate professional documentation for your codebase using Doxygen.
* Install: Install your library and its headers to a specified location.

# How to Use
* Clone the repository.
* Rename the project:
   * Replace all instances of `CMakeLibTemplate` with your project name.
* Make sure your project follows the same directory structure.
